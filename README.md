# Event's Site

This is a back-end application that provides users with reliable, adequate, and up-to-date information about events and meetup places. This application also implements a rating and review system for suggested events, occasions, and meetups. Additionally, it offers a convenient ticket purchase system for events that require booking and purchasing tickets.
 

## Key Features

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely.

- User Profiles: Users can view and update their profiles, ensuring their information is always current.

- Event Discovery: Users can easily find events and meetups. They can search by location, category, and time to discover events that match their preferences.

- Rating and Reviews: Users can rate and review events, providing valuable feedback to other users and event organizers.

- Social Sharing: Users can share events on popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, expanding the event's reach.

- Ticket Purchase/Reservation: For events that require it, users can buy tickets or book reservations directly through the platform.

- Like/Unlike Events: Users can express their interest in events by liking or unliking them.

- User-friendly Interface: We prioritize a user-friendly and intuitive interface to ensure a seamless user experience.


## Future Considerations

I have plans for further improving and developing a front-end web application in the future:

- **Mobile App**: I envision converting the website into an Android application to reach a broader audience and provide a more seamless experience for users on mobile devices.

- **Payment Options**: In addition to credit card payments, I plan to integrate alternative payment options to cater to a wider range of users.

- **International Expansion**: My goal is to expand content and services beyond national borders, making it a valuable resource for travelers worldwide.
