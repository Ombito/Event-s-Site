# Eventâ€™s Site


## Problem statement: 
In a country where local tourism is currently on the rise, finding the right go to places for a weekend away with friends or family can be a huge hustle. Mostly because the information found online  on social media platforms  is either limited to certain class or groups of people, unreliable, inadequate,insufficient and sometimes fraud schemes.


## Solution: 
- An application where users are offered reliable, adequate and up to date information about events and meet up places.
- This application also implements rating and review of suggested events, occasions and meet ups.
And a ticket purchase system for events that involve ticket booking and purchasing.

## Future consideration:
- In the future, the application can be converted into an android application
- Integrate other payment options other than credit card.
- And also expand our content beyond our National borders.
